## A responsive on-line portfolio 
Last major update: 12/9/20

#### Description
This is the repo for my online portfolio. In the beginning, it was a great way to learn more about basic html and css (grid structures, rows, columns, pseudo-classes, accessibility, responsiveness, Boostrap, Google fonts, Font Awesome icons, etc.). I'll continue to update it with new features and a full portfolio in the future. 

#### Credits
This project would not be possible without the help of the instructors, teaching assistants, and students who joined the Fall 2020 UNC-Chapel Hill coding bootcamp.
